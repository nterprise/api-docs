    "description": "Recognizing that production Facilities typically have assets that are utilized during the production process, niagara introduced the concept of Resources.  These can be physical: examples include assembly lines, individual machines, work stations, and network ports. Resources may also be virtual, such as the number of VPN connections that can be established simultaneously.\n\nResources are useful for allocating and balancing workloads, good information for KPI reporting, and may help identify a bottleneck in the production flow.\n\nniagara also supports Sub-Resources, which are essentially the same, but broken down another level.  For example, a Work Station (Resource) may contain multiple Slots (Sub-Resources) into which devices may be connected for processing.\n\nOther Location types may have Resources as well.  For example, a customer office building (Site) may contain a storage room, a data center, and many offices and cubicles; each of which may be defined as a Resource for planning and execution of work orders.",
